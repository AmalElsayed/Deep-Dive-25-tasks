1- What is React?
 React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 It allows me to create small reusable components and combine them to build complete pages.

2- Why we use React?
 we use React because it makes writing code easier instead of dealing directly with the DOM.
 It also improves performance with the Virtual DOM and helps me organize and reuse my code.

3- React is a framework or library? and why?
 React is a library, not a framework. The reason is that React only focuses on the UI part. 
 It doesn’t force me to use a specific structure for the whole project.
 I can choose other libraries for things like routing or state management.

========================================================================================================

4- When we use React?
 I use React when I’m working on medium or large projects that need a dynamic UI,
 like e-commerce websites or dashboards. 
 But if the project is small and static, I don’t really need React.
